## Project Overview

Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, and early detection can save lives. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training using multiple algorithms
- Performance Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
- Insights and visualization to aid interpretability

## Dataset

The dataset contains features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health metrics. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

### Source
The dataset was sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) or similar publicly available data. Ensure compliance with the dataset's licensing and usage terms.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dawood-ML/EDA-heart-disease-prediction-with-scikit-learn.git
   cd EDA-heart-disease-prediction-with-Scikit-learn
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `End-to-End-Heart-disease-Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells step by step to:
   - Understand the data and preprocess it.
   - Train models and evaluate their performance.
   - View visualizations and insights.

## Results
